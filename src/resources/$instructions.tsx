const PanicAttackdescription =
    `If someone you know has a panic attack, they may become very anxious and not think clearly. But there are things you can do to help:

• Stay with the person and keep calm.
• Move the person to a quiet place.
• Ask what the person needs.
• Speak to the person in short, simple sentences.
• Be predictable, and avoid surprises.
• Help the person focus.
• Ask the person to repeat a simple, physically tiring task such as raising his or her arms over the head.

Help slow the person's breathing.
You can do this by breathing with him or her or by counting slowly to 10.

Know what to say.
It's helpful when the person is having a panic attack to say things such as:
• "You can get through this."
• "I'm proud of you. Good job."
• "Tell me what you need now."
• "Concentrate on your breathing. Stay in the present."
• "It's not the place that is bothering you; it's the thought."
• "What you are feeling is scary, but it's not dangerous."

By using these tips, you can help:
• Reduce the amount of stress in this very stressful situation.
• Prevent the situation from getting worse.
• Put some control in a confusing situation.`

const GreaseFiredescription = `How to Put Out a Grease Fire
A fire needs 3 things to burn. They are Heat, Oxygen, and Fuel. A fire will keep growing untilone of those is removed.

Cooking doesn't normally present a lot of danger. You might nick your finger while chopping vegetables or manage to burn a pan of roasting potatoes, but in terms of actual danger to ourselves or our homes, not so much. Except for grease fires. Do you know what to do if your cooking oil catches fire?

A grease fire happens when your cooking oil becomes too hot. When heating, oils first start to boil, then they'll start smoking, and then they'll catch on fire. Most vegetable oils have a smoking point around 450°F, while animal fats like lard or goose fat will start smoking around 375°F.

The very best safety is prevention. Whenever you're heating oil for pan-frying or deep-fat frying, stay in the kitchen. Use a heavy pot with a lid and clip a thermometer to the side so you know the temperature of the oil.

Keep an eye on the oil as it's heating. If you see wisps of smoke or smell something acrid, immediately turn down the heat or remove the pot from the burner completely. The oil won't immediately catch fire once it starts smoking, but smoke is a danger sign that it's well on its way to getting there.

If the worst happens and your oil does catch on fire, do the following:
• Turn the Heat Off - Don't try to move the pot. You might accidentally splash yourself or your kitchen with burning oil. And that would be bad.
• Cover the Pot with a Metal Lid - Fire cannot exist in the absence of oxygen. With the lid on (and the heat off), the fire should quickly consume all the oxygen and put itself out. Use a metal lid since glass will shatter.
• Pour on Baking Soda - Baking soda will extinguish grease fires, but only if they're small. It takes a lot of baking soda to do the job.
• Spray the Pot with a Class B Dry Chemical Fire Extinguisher - This is your last resort, as fire extinguishers will contaminate your kitchen. Still, it's better than the alternative if the fire is getting out of control.
• Get Out and Call 911 - If the fire does break out of control, don't try to be a hero. Get out and find a phone to call 911.
----------------------------------------------------------
The safest way to put out a grease fire burning in a pan…

Remove the oxygen.

Here’s how…

Put on Oven Mitts to protect your hands.

Get the lid that fits the pan and ‘slide’ it across the top of the pan to smother the flames. Or, use a cookie sheet and ‘slide’ it over the top of the burning pan.

Shut off the burner to stop adding heat.

Leave the pan alone, don’t move it, and don’t remove the lid until it has cooled completely.

Other ways to put out grease fires…

Use a class B or BC or ABC fire extinguisher.

A Fire Extinguisher will release a-lot of pressure, so start at a distance away and move towards the fire, rather than up-close spraying directly on to the burning grease which could tip the pan and spread the fire.

You could also…Carefully pour a good amount of baking soda onto the grease fire.


Or…Soak a towel under the faucet, wring out the excess dripping water, and drape over the burning grease pan to smother it. (This is very effective, quick and easy!)
Things NOT TO DO with a grease fire

DO NOT Move the Pot or Carry It Outside - Throwing the pot outside might seem logical in the frenzy of the moment. But trying to move the pot might splash burning oil on you, your home, and anything around you.

DO NOT douse the grease fire with water, or milk, etc…If you do, it will explode into a fireball. Pouring water can cause the oil to splash and spread the fire. The vaporizing water can also carry grease particles in it, also spreading the fire.

DO NOT Throw Any Other Baking Product on the Fire - Flour might look like baking soda, flour is combustible.and it won't react the same as baking soda. Only baking soda can help put out a grease fire.`

const CPRdescription = `Giving CPR
1. CHECK the scene for safety, form an initial impression and use personal protective equipment (PPE)
----------------------------------------------------------
2. If the person appears unresponsive, CHECK for responsiveness, breathing, life-threatening bleeding or other life-threatening conditions using shout-tap-shout
----------------------------------------------------------
3. If the person does not respond and is not breathing or only gasping, CALL 9-1-1 and get equipment, or tell someone to do so
----------------------------------------------------------
4. Kneel beside the person. Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface
----------------------------------------------------------
5. Give 30 chest compressions
  - Hand position: Two hands centered on the chest
  - Body position: Shoulders directly over hands; elbows locked
  - Depth: At least 2 inches
  - Rate: 100 to 120 per minute
  - Allow chest to return to normal position after each compression
----------------------------------------------------------
6. Give 2 breaths
  - Open the airway to a past-neutral position using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique
  - Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, and make complete seal over the person’s mouth with your mouth.
  - Ensure each breath lasts about 1 second and makes the chest rise; allow air to exit before giving the next breath
  - Note: If the 1st breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head and ensure a proper seal before giving the 2nd breath If the 2nd breath does not make the chest rise, an object may be blocking the airway
----------------------------------------------------------
7. Continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. Use an AED as soon as one is available! Minimize interruptions to chest compressions to less than 10 seconds.`;

const Licedescription = `Self care
If you prefer not to use a medication for treating head lice, you may consider a home treatment. However, there's little to no clinical evidence that home treatments are effective.

Wet-combing
- Combing wet hair with a fine-toothed nit comb may remove lice and some nits. Studies show that wet-combing results vary.

Start by wetting the hair and lubricating it with hair conditioner or olive oil. Comb the entire head from the scalp to the end of the hair at least twice during a session. The process typically should be repeated every 3 to 4 days for several weeks — at least two weeks after no more lice are found.

Essential oils
- Small clinical studies have suggested that some natural plant oils may kill lice by depriving them of air, but effectiveness is uncertain. These products include:

• Tea tree oil
• Anise oil
• Ylang-ylang oil
Essential oils aren't required to meet safety, efficacy and manufacturing standards used for drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and can sometimes cause allergic reactions.

Smothering agents
- A number of household products are used to treat head lice. These products are thought to deprive the lice of air when generous amounts are applied to the hair, covered with a shower cap and left on overnight. Products used for this purpose include:

• Mayonnaise
• Olive oil
• Margarine or butter
• Petroleum jelly

However, it's unclear if these treatments are effective.

Dehydration
Another option is a machine that uses one application of hot air to kill head lice and their eggs through dehydration. The machine requires special training and is currently available only at professional lice treatment centers.

The machine uses air that is cooler than most hair dryers and at a much higher flow rate to kill the lice by drying them out. Don't use a regular hair dryer to accomplish this result as it's too hot and could burn the scalp.

Dangerous products to avoid
Flammable products, such as kerosene or gasoline, should never be used to kill lice or to remove nits.

Household cleaning
Lice usually don't live past one day without feeding from a human scalp. And eggs can't survive without the temperature near the scalp. Therefore, the chance of lice surviving on household items is small.

As a precaution, you may clean items that the affected person has used in the previous two days. Cleaning recommendations include the following:

• Wash items in hot water. Wash bedding, stuffed animals and clothing in hot, soapy water — at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) — and dry at high heat.
• Clean hair care items. Clean combs, brushes and hair accessories by soaking them in hot, soapy water for 5 to 10 minutes.
• Seal items in plastic bags. Seal items that can't be washed in plastic bags for two weeks.
• Vacuum. Give the floor and upholstered furniture a good vacuuming.`

const Wounddescription = `Step 1: Examine the wound and call for help.
When someone appears to be badly wounded, try to quickly understand the nature and severity of their injury.

Do:
Remove any clothing, jewelry, or other items that may be covering the wound or make it harder to access.

Try to gauge the size and depth of the wound.

Call 9-1-1 if the wound looks deep, or severe, or appears to be losing a large amount of blood.
Do not:
Try to remove or extract an object from a wound.

Clean the wound.

Move the wounded person, unless they are in a place that is still dangerous to them.
Step 2: Stop a wound from bleeding.
Just stopping the bleeding from a serious wound can be the most important thing you can do until either emergency responders arrive, or you’re able to transport the injured person to a hospital or other nearby medical facility.

Do:
Cover the wound with a sterile dressing (if available) or a clean cloth.

Apply direct pressure to the wound until bleeding stops (except in the cases noted below).

Add additional layers of bandages to contain the flow if blood soaks through the first dressing.

Elevate the wound above the level of the heart if possible.

Keep the wounded person as still as you can until emergency help arrives or until you’ve transported them.

Cover the person with a blanket, jacket, or other available cover if they’re shivering or showing signs of going into shock.
Do not:
Apply pressure to an eye or head injury, or to any wound where an object is embedded.

Use a tourniquet if you haven’t had training to use one correctly.
If necessary, you can also apply all these steps to yourself if no one is present to help you.`

const ODdescription = `While there are substantial efforts to address opioid addiction, it is important to understand what to do if you witness an opioid overdose.

1. Look for Symptoms

Here are some of the most common symptoms of an overdose:

Unresponsive or unconscious
Gasping, snoring, or no breathing at all
Shallow or slow breathing
Blue lips and blue fingertips
Clammy skin
2. Call 911

If you suspect someone has overdosed, call 911 immediately and try to help the person onto his or her side to prevent choking.

Key information to share with 911 after requesting an ambulance:

Your exact location
Your phone number so they can call you back if the call drops, along with any visible drugs or alcohol that may be contributing to the overdose
Note that most states have enacted Good Samaritan laws, which may offer protection for those who report an overdose in good faith, even if criminal activity is involved. These laws encourage members of the community, family members, and friends to call 911 in the event of witnessing an overdose.`

const Heimlichdescription =
`Step 1: Call 9-1-1 for help in a choking emergency.
If you suspect someone is choking, call 9-1-1 to get help and relay the situation.

If another person is present, one of you should try to help the choking person while the other dials 9-1-1.

Step 2: Assess the situation and try sharp blows to the back.
The Heimlich maneuver should not be performed on someone who can still talk, breathe, or cough.

Here’s what you can do:

Encourage further coughing to dislodge any obstruction or cause of choking.
Determine if the person can talk, cough, or breathe.
Look for the universal choking sign (holding the throat).
If a person can’t talk, breathe, or cough:

Try up to 5 sharp blows to the back with the heel of your hand, between the person’s shoulder blades.
Step 3: How to do the Heimlich maneuver
If blows to the back don’t clear the blockage, perform abdominal thrusts. Here’s how:

Stand behind the choking person (or kneel if you are helping a young child).
Wrap your arms around their torso, from the back.
Make a fist with one hand and grab it with the other.
Place your hands just above the belly button and below the ribcage.
Pull inward and upward on the diaphragm to force air out of the lungs to expel the blockage.
Repeat up to 5 times.
Step 4: Alternate back blows and Heimlich maneuver if choking continues.
If the person still can’t breathe, talk, or cough, continue giving 5 back blows followed by 5 abdominal thrusts until you clear the blockage or help arrives.`
